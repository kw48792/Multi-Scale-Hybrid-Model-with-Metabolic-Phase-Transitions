# Multi-Scale Hybrid Model with Metabolic Phase Transitions

This repository contains the code and data used in the journal paper: **"Multi-Scale Hybrid Modeling to Predict Cell Culture Process with Metabolic Phase Transitions"**

## Overview

This project implements a multi-scale hybrid modeling approach for predicting cell culture processes with metabolic phase transitions. The model combines mechanistic and data-driven approaches to capture complex cellular behaviors during bioprocessing.
