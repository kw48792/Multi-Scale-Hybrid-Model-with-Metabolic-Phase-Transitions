🧬 Multi-Scale Hybrid Model with Metabolic Phase Transitions

Multi-scale hybrid modeling framework to predict CHO cell culture dynamics with metabolic phase transitions

This repository contains Python scripts and data required to reproduce the modeling, prediction, and visualization results described in the manuscript “Multi-Scale Hybrid Modeling for CHO Cell Culture Processes with Metabolic Phase Transitions.”
